# TODO List

## Completed Tasks

### OS Detection Refactoring âœ…
- Created centralized OS detection module (`os_detector.py`) using enumeration
- Implemented singleton pattern to ensure OS is detected only once
- Added OS-specific utility methods (modifier keys, key sequences, timing delays)
- Refactored all modules to use centralized OS detection:
  - `main.py` - Removed redundant OS detection
  - `key_simulator.py` - Uses centralized OS detection and timing
  - `mouse_controller.py` - Uses centralized OS detection
  - `button_definitions.py` - Uses centralized modifier key detection
  - `instance_manager.py` - Uses centralized OS detection for factory functions
  - `setup_and_run.py` - Uses centralized OS detection for platform-specific logic
- Eliminated redundant `platform.system()` calls across the codebase
- Improved maintainability by centralizing OS-specific logic

## Pending Tasks

### Code Quality
- Review and fix any remaining linter errors
- Add comprehensive unit tests for OS detection module
- Add integration tests for cross-platform functionality

### Features
- Add support for additional operating systems if needed
- Implement OS-specific optimizations for performance
- Add configuration options for OS-specific behavior

### Documentation
- Update README.md to reflect the new OS detection architecture
- Add developer documentation for the OS detection module
- Document OS-specific considerations and limitations

### Testing
- Test on all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Verify OS-specific key sequences work correctly
- Test timing delays for different operating systems
